**Files included**: `index.html`, `style.css`, `README.md`.

## Which AI tool I used
I used **Replit AI** to generate an initial HTML/CSS template and structure. The generated code served as a starting point.

## What I edited manually
- Cleaned up and simplified the HTML structure for accessibility (semantic sections and aria labels).
- Implemented a **CSS-only hamburger menu** using the checkbox hack so the project remains HTML + CSS only.
- Wrote the responsive breakpoints: desktop (≥1024px), tablet (768–1023px), and mobile (≤767px).
- Created the skills grid and hover animations.
- Tuned spacing, colors, and added a subtle entrance animation and button hover effect.
- Ensured no horizontal scroll on small screens by adjusting layout and container padding.
